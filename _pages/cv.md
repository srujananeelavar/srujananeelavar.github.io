# Work experience

- **Graduate Research Assistant**, _Pittsburgh, PA_ <span style="color:grey">— Jan 2023 – Present</span>

  _Hiller Lab, Carnegie Mellon University_

  - Conducted a comparative genomics analysis to assess the covariance between the regulator Rgg144 and its corresponding signal peptides, namely SHP144, rio120, rio121, and rio122 in _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.
  - Designed and generated a network diagram to elucidate the specificity of interactions between the regulator and the signal peptides to understand cell-cell communication in pneumococcus.

- **Graduate Teaching Assistant**, _Pittsburgh, PA_ <span style="color:grey">— Aug 2023 – Dec 2023</span>

  _Carnegie Mellon University_

  - Contributed to the development of students' professional communication skills by focusing on elevator pitch refinement and interview techniques and offered guidance on effectively tailoring of communication to diverse audiences.
  - Conducted and evaluated mock interviews to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing students to practice articulating their professional skills and experiences.

- **Bioscientific Content Developer**, _Remote_ <span style="color:grey">— Dec 2021 – May 2022</span>

  _BioLim Centre for Science & Technology_

  - Independently developed and authored bioscientific content, encompassing short articles and textbook materials, by conducting comprehensive literature reviews and synthesizing information from diverse sources.
  - Conducted rigorous copy-editing, ensuring clarity and adherence to style guidelines, while implementing quality control measures to maintain accuracy in scientific publications for both internal and external audiences.

- **Research Intern**, _Bangalore, India_ <span style="color:grey">— Aug 2020 – Sep 2020</span>

  _Center of Excellence Computational Genomics, RV College of Engineering_

  - Identified hit compounds from _Citrus limon_ as potential natural GPVI receptor antagonists through High Throughput Screening using bioinformatics tools like BLAST, MEGA X, Clustal W and AutoDock Tools.
  - Examined the interaction of hit compounds and GPVI receptor through Molecular Dynamics Simulation using GROMACS.
