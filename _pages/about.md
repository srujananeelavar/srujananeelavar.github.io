üî¨ My journey in the realm of science began as an undergraduate in Biotechnology where I explored drug discovery, structural biology, proteomics and genomics, genetics and microbiology. Amidst the chaos of our times, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgency of leveraging computational biology. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself at the forefront of the battle against the virus. As a **junior research fellow at [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/research/research-units/theoretical-sciences-unit)**, I performed **coevolutionary analysis** on the receptor binding domain of the SARS CoV-2 genome. Further, as a **Research Assistant at the [Hiller Lab](https://www.bio.cmu.edu/labs/hiller/)** at CMU, I am specifically exploring the **covariance between the alleles of regulator Rgg144 and its cognate signal peptide SHP144**. In this age of information, my skills are not just tools in my academic toolkit; they are instruments of change and progress.

üìö I am currently working on my Master‚Äôs Thesis, where I unravel the intricacies of cell-cell communication systems in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. This endeavor is not just a scholarly pursuit; it's a commitment to understanding the molecular intricacies that underpin diseases, striving to contribute to the arsenal of knowledge that can shape future healthcare paradigms.

‚ú® Beyond the laboratory and the screen, I find solace and joy in expressing my creativity through **dancing, painting, and cooking**. Each of these endeavors serves as a canvas for my artistic soul, allowing me to recharge and approach my scientific endeavors with a fresh perspective. My love for exploration extends beyond the realm of academia, as I seek to immerse myself in diverse cultures and landscapes through travel and hiking. I additionally enjoy editing videos and creating a repository of memories through them. This adds an exciting dimension to my life, providing inspiration and fostering a holistic approach to learning.

Keen on learning and growing, I embrace every opportunity for personal and professional development, ensuring that my journey is one of perpetual self-discovery. Join me in this adventure at the intersection of biology and data science, where each discovery is a stepping stone towards a brighter and healthier future.
