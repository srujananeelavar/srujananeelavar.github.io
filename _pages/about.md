![Illustration of computer and microbiology](/images/compscimicrobio.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👩🏾‍💻 I'm a Computational Biology Graduate Student at the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cbd.cmu.edu).

🔬 Harmonizing data science and biology to develop tailored personalized therapeutic strategies, with a specialized emphasis on microbiology, comparative genomics, evolutionary bioinformatics, and the comprehensive exploration of various diseases and conditions.

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis, unraveling the intricacies of cell-cell communication systems in <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.

✨ I find immense joy in expressing my creativity through dancing, painting, and cooking—each a canvas for my artistic soul. My love for exploring new cultures and landscapes, whether through travel or hiking, adds an exciting dimension to my life. Keen on learning and growing, I embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills, ensuring a journey of perpetual self-discovery.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions

I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers

I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience

Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions

To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
