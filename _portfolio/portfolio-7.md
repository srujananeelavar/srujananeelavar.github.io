# Introduction

The causative agent of the Covid-19 pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), was first reported in December 2019. It is a highly contagious and pathogenic virus that spreads rapidly and has posed a health threat to the global population. SARS-CoV2 belongs to the beta coronaviruses family of viruses and possesses a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome (Zhou et al., 2020). It has a sequence similarity of >79% with the SARS-CoV Coronaviridae (Hui et al., 2020).

The RNA genome of SARS-CoV2 consists of around six open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1a/b encodes two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab which furthermore leads to the production of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsPs). The other ORFs of the viral genome give rise to the production of Spike protein (S), Envelope protein (E), Membrane protein (M) and Nucleocapsid protein (N) - the four main structural factors of the virion (Hussain et al., 2005).

The heterotrimeric Spike protein on the surface of SARS-Co2 consists of S1 and S2 subunits. It is used to interact with the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) cellular receptor (Wong et al., 2004). The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV2 is composed of the receptor binding domain (RBD 318-513 amino acids) and shares 73% identity with the RBD of SARS-CoV (Lokman et al., 2020). To cause the SARS-CoV2 infection, the RBD of S1 subunit binds to the peptidase domain of ACE2 on host cell membrane, while the cleaved site of S2 subunit is exposed for further cleavage by host protease (Belouzard et al., 2009).

We must characterize the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular sequences along with the alternative trajectories that could have been taken but were not, to understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did (Smith, 1970). The aim of this project is to mimic the natural process of genetic variation through mutations and predict the possible sequence space in the evolution of the SARS-CoV2 genome.

# Data

GISAID (A global initiative on sharing avian flu data) is a primary source which provides open access to genomic data of influenza viruses and the coronavirus (Shu & McCauley, 2017). GISAID helps in the facilitation of genomic epidemiology and real-time surveillance to monitor emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the globe.

As of August 9th 2021, the SARS-CoV2 database, EpiCoV, has over 2,641,383 submissions. Sequences were downloaded based on the location (Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America and South America). Out of the 2,641,383 sequences that are available on the database, around 1,886,191 (71.4%) of the sequences were downloaded for further analysis.
