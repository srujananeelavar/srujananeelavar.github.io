The research focuses on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as a pivotal receptor in angiogenesis, with implications in diseases like cancer and macular degeneration. Current FDA-approved drugs face limitations, prompting the exploration of new VEGFR2 inhibitors using the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) method. Studies employing QSAR modeling have identified promising candidate compounds, showcasing the potential of in silico screening. Building upon these findings, the proposed project aims to deepen the understanding of molecular descriptors for effective VEGFR2 inhibitors, ultimately constructing a QSAR model for predicting inhibition activity. This research may streamline drug discovery, offering innovative solutions for cancer, retinal diseases, and inflammatory conditions.
